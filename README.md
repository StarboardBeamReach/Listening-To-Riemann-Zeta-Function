# Listening-To-Riemann-Zeta-Function

REQUIRES: JFUGUE LIBRARY-5.0.9 which can be downloaded from www.jfugue.org

The Riemann Zeta Function is a famous equation that maps complex numbers
to another set of complex numbers. The formula is studied for its impacts
on prime numbers and has practical applicates in many fields such as 
condensed matter physic. 

This program calculates and graphs an approximation of the Riemann Zeta function
by summing the first n terms of the infinite series. Music is then played
based on the real and imaginary components of that complex output.

It uses multithreading to get the music and the visuals to run simultaneously.
It also uses the JFugue library to generate chord progressions.
